## Not validated — next step is an on-air test

Nothing multi-cell has run on real SDRs or radios yet; Asterisk has only been type-checked (it needs
the native codec). Suggested test with two Pluto+ and Brew enabled, in this order:

1. Both cells come up (`cell1: cell stack running` in the log; Cells card shows both RF online).
2. Radios on each cell in one talkgroup: talk on one, hear on the other; answer during hangtime.
3. Both press PTT together → only one gets through. Emergency call takes the floor.
4. Individual call between cells; SDS between cells (ISSI and group).
5. Walk a radio between cells (or lower one Pluto's TX gain): stays registered, keeps its group call.
   Log: `SiteSwitch: ISSI … moved cell0 → cell1`. With a terminal that supports it: announced
   handover (`MLE: U-PREPARE … → D-NEW-CELL`).
6. Radio field-test display: both cells listed as neighbours; reselection thresholds read
   20/10/10/6 dB.
7. If used: PBX calls to/from radios on cell 1; WX request on cell 1.

## Most likely to need correction after testing

- Bit layout from our reading of EN 300 392-2 (verify on a terminal): the 16-bit cell re-select
  parameters (slow thr | fast thr | slow hyst | fast hyst, 2 dB units), the neighbour main carrier
  number extension (band 4 | offset 2 | duplex 3 | reverse 1), D-NEW-CELL channel command valid = 1,
  fail causes sent as 0, `cell_reselection_types_supported` = 3 meaning "both".
- Voice between cells: playout buffer depth / latency (reuses Brew's `VoiceJitterBuffer`).
- Hangtime handovers between cells (a cell's CMCE handling a network call start while its own call
  hangs, and a local PTT during a network call).

## Known limits (by design, documented)

- Linking needs Brew or LST; without them each cell runs alone (Asterisk then primary-only).
- Individual calls don't survive a change of cell.
- A group call spanning cells shows once per cell in the Calls list.
- Only MM's first answer to a forwarded registration is captured; follow-up MM PDUs go on air on
  the target cell.
- CPU / bandwidth with several SDRs on one Pi untested; start with two cells.

## Housekeeping

- The first workstation has a local git stash on `beta` ("multi-cell phase 1 (from beta d3c7f00)")
  and an unpushed `beta` commit `ad4a60c` (test fix). Both are local only and superseded by `bost`;
  nothing needs to be carried over.
- No `v0.5.0` git tag or GitHub release has been created.
