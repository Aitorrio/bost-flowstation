//! Site switch: makes the cells of a multi-cell station look like one stack to the network
//! entity (Brew or LST Dispatch).
//!
//! Every cell's radio stack runs on its own thread with its own router. The network entity lives
//! only in the primary router, wrapped by [`SiteSwitch`] in the `TetraEntity::Brew` slot. Each
//! additional cell has a [`CellLink`] in its Brew slot that forwards everything to the switch.
//!
//! Once cells are linked (`StackConfig::is_site_linked`) they report every registration, group
//! floor and call to their network slot; the switch applies the Brew routing rules before
//! anything reaches the real network entity. The switch:
//! * tracks where radios are registered and which cells have members of each group;
//! * routes network → stack messages to the right cell: by carrier (carriers are unique per
//!   cell), by Brew session UUID, by destination ISSI/GSSI location, else to the primary;
//! * fans a network group call out to every cell with members, forwards only the first
//!   `NetworkCallReady` to the network entity and copies its downlink voice to the other cells;
//! * lets a radio's group call be heard on the other cells: they get it as a network call and
//!   the talker's uplink voice is copied to them; one talker per group site-wide (a radio that
//!   takes the floor while another cell's radio talks is pulled into that call instead);
//! * connects individual calls between radios on different cells by passing the circuit-call
//!   signalling across (each CMCE sees the other as the network) and copying the voice;
//! * delivers SDS between cells directly, renumbers call identifiers, and mirrors the network
//!   link state from the primary to the other cells.
